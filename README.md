# Project Goal: 
Determine what drives customers of Telco to stop doing business with them.
 
# Description: 
Using Statistical tests and modeling, you can narrow down the reasons why customers of Telco cease business. 

I focused on 8 features out of the 24 that I determined were more detrimental to the churn of customers.

# Initial Hypotheses: 
Customers at Telco are leaving due to unsatisfactory services that are provided
 
# Initial Questions:
 
- Are certain groups (age, gender, etc.) of customers unsatisfied with our service?
 
- Do we offer products/services(internet types) that do not meet expectations?
 
- Do we lack customer support?
 
- Do we need to put more focus on the types of contracts we offer for customers?
 
# Data Dictionary:
Decision Tree: To avoid overfitting, a max depth of 3 was used
KNN: Using the 10 nearest neighbors of points within my data
LR: Logistic regression model using default parameters

# Planning (lay out your process through the data science pipeline):

 
# Findings, Recommendations, and Takeaways:
Focusing on the 8 features help enhance the models ability to determine churn compared to using all features
